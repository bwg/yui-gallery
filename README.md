SmugMug YUI Gallery Modules
===========================

This repo contains open source YUI components that have been contributed to the
[YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) by
[SmugMug](http://www.smugmug.com).


Modules
-------

### [gallery-sm-menu](src/sm-menu)

An awesome menu widget that makes it easy to create standalone menus, dropdown
menus, and context menus.

### [gallery-sm-treeview](src/sm-treeview)

A powerful, easy to use, and extremely fast TreeView widget.

### [gallery-sm-dom-form-values](src/sm-dom-form-values)

Adds a `Y.DOM.formToObject(identifier)` method to extract form values from the
DOM.


Works in Progress
-----------------

### [gallery-sm-dragdrop](src/sm-dragdrop)

_Work in progress_. A simpler and more efficient drag and drop implementation
than the one in YUI core. Highly optimized for delegation-based drag targets,
remaining responsive and memory-efficient even when managing thousands of
draggable nodes.

### [gallery-sm-editor](src/sm-editor)

_Work in progress_. A simple but powerful contentEditable-based WYSIWYG editor.

### [gallery-sm-focusmanager](src/sm-focusmanager)

_Work in progress_. A Y.Node plugin that makes it easy to manage keyboard focus
among the descendants of a node. This is a replacement for the
soon-to-be-deprecated core Y.Plugin.NodeFocusManager component in YUI.

### [gallery-sm-selection](src/sm-selection)

_Work in progress_. Cross-browser Selection and Range APIs.
